An HTML web app that contains some tools I thought were useful mainly for myself.
The electric vehicle I own doesn't have any way of setting a charge percent limit, so I created this web app to make calculating what time to set the charge timer to very easy
I figure I'll add more features as I see fit but currently the features are:

Features:
- Charge Time Calculator
  Enter your current battery percent, and it will calculate what time it will be done charging along with other fun info like kWh required and cost
  you also have parameters such as desired SOC percent, Battery Size (kWh), and Charge Rate (kW) to tune it to your vehicle and charging situation
